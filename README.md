# Updated Guesslang

This is an updated version of the original [Guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang), which relied on an outdated version of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
This version was adjusted to use newer version of Tensorflow, while still keeping the original functionality and API.
