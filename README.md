# Updated Guesslang

This is an updated version of the original [Guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang), which relied on an outdated version of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
This version was adjusted to use newer version of Tensorflow, while still keeping the original functionality and API.

**Original README file is available [here](original_README.md)**

## What Changed
* `guesslang/model.py`
* `requirements.txt`

## Installation
Currently only installation available is from source. Will be added to PyPI later.
